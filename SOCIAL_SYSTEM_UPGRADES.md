# Social System Upgrades - Living, Breathing Social Network

## Overview
Massive upgrade to the social system making NPCs feel truly alive! NPCs now proactively message you, reply to comments, mention you in posts, and automatically react to your content.

---

## 🎯 Feature 1: Player @TheBoss Username

### What Was Added
- Player now has permanent username: **@TheBoss**
- Shows next to "You" in all social feed posts and comments
- Special styling: Red/pink color with glow effect
- NPCs can mention @TheBoss in their posts and comments

### Implementation Details

**Post Headers:**
- Player posts show: `You @TheBoss` (red username with glow)
- Red border on player avatar (instead of blue like NPCs)

**Comments:**
- Player comments show: `You @TheBoss`
- Mention detection works for @TheBoss (special highlight)

**linkifyMentions() Function:**
```javascript
// Special handling for @TheBoss
if (username.toLowerCase() === 'theboss') {
  return styled with red color and glow effect
}
```

### Visual Design
- Username color: `#e94560` (hot pink/red)
- Text shadow: Glowing effect
- Avatar border: Red to match username
- Clickable for NPCs, non-clickable for player

## 💬 Feature 2: NPC Comment Reply System

### What Was Added
NPCs now **automatically reply** to player comments on their posts!

### How It Works

1. **Player Comments on NPC Post**
   - System detects post belongs to NPC
   - 70% chance NPC will reply

2. **Reply Generation**
   - **Delay**: 2-5 seconds (realistic timing)
   - **Context-Aware**: Analyzes post content, comment tone, relationship
   - **Tone Matching**: Adjusts reply based on intimacy/affection levels

3. **Tone System:**
   - **Flirty** (intimacy > 80): "Thanks babe 😏"
   - **Warm** (intimacy > 60 OR affection > 60): "Aww thank you! 💕"
   - **Appreciative** (compliments): "You're sweet!"
   - **Playful** (if comment has lol/haha): "Right?? 😂"
   - **Professional** (default): "Thanks for the feedback"

### AI Prompt Features
```
- Post context (type, content, image)
- Player's comment
- Personality traits (confidence, flirtiness, humor)
- Relationship stats (intimacy, affection, type)
- Tone instruction based on relationship
```

### Memory Integration
- NPC remembers: "Boss commented X, I replied Y"
- Stored as interaction (importance: 2)

### Implementation
**Function:** `generateNPCCommentReply(post, playerComment)`
- Called async after player comments
- Max 100 characters
- Auto-refreshes feed when reply posts

---

## 📱 Feature 3: Closed Chat Response Fix

### The Problem
When player sent a message and closed the chat window:
- Response would fail to generate
- Or response would generate but not be stored
- UI elements were null, breaking the function

### The Solution

**Key Changes:**

1. **Store Employee ID Early**
   ```javascript
   const employeeId = gameState.activeChat.id;
   const employeeName = gameState.activeChat.name;
   ```

2. **Check if Chat Still Open**
   ```javascript
   if (!gameState.activeChat || gameState.activeChat.id !== employeeId) {
     // Mark as unread instead of trying to show
     emp.unreadMessages++;
   }
   ```

3. **Conditional UI Updates**
   - Only update UI if chat still open
   - Always save to history (works even if closed)
   - Only show typing indicator if chat open

4. **Unread Messages System**
   - If chat closes: Increment `npc.unreadMessages`
   - Opens chat: Reset to 0
   - Updates People tab badge

### Result
✅ Responses complete even if you close chat mid-generation  
✅ Messages wait for you in history  
✅ Unread badge appears on People tab  
✅ No more failed responses!

## 🔔 Feature 4: Proactive NPC Messaging

### Overview
**NPCs now message YOU first!** Based on relationship, time since last chat, recent events, work context, and intimacy level.

### Trigger System

**Evaluation Factors:**
1. **Time Since Last Message**
   - Won't message if less than 1 hour
   - Bonus chance increases with time (up to +10%)

2. **Relationship Bonus**
   - Base: 5% chance
   - +15% max from relationship level
   - +20% max from intimacy level

3. **Total Chance Calculation:**
   ```
   Total = Base (5%) + Relationship Bonus (0-15%) + Intimacy Bonus (0-20%) + Time Bonus (0-10%)
   Maximum: 50% chance per check
   ```

### Message Types

**Work-Related:**
- `work_question`: "Quick question about the TechStarter project..."
- `work_update`: "Just finished that report you asked for!"

**Personal:**
- `casual_chat` (affection > 30): "Hey! How's your day going?"
- `sharing_news` (affection > 50): "You won't believe what happened..."
- `asking_advice` (trust > 60): "Can I ask you something?"

**Social:**
- `post_followup`: "Did you see my post? 😊"
- References their recent posts from last 24h

**Intimate:**
- `flirty_message` (intimacy > 40): "Thinking about you 😏"
- `booty_call` (intimacy > 70): "Free tonight? 👀"

**Event-Based:**
- `event_reaction`: React to recent company events involving them

### AI Prompt System

The system builds context-rich prompts:
- Personality traits (confidence, flirtiness, humor)
- Relationship stats (affection, intimacy, type)
- Recent conversation history (last 5 messages)
- Reason for messaging
- Specific context (post, event, etc.)

**Tone Matching:**
- Intimate (60+): Comfortable being flirty and personal
- Warm (50+): Friendly and warm tone
- Professional (<30): Keep it professional
- High humor (70+): Add some humor

### Check Frequency
- **Interval:** Every 2 minutes
- **Max per check:** 1-2 messages (70% chance of just 1)
- **Min cooldown between checks:** 1 minute

### Implementation
**Function:** `checkForProactiveMessages()`
- Runs on setInterval (120000ms = 2 minutes)
- Calls `evaluateProactiveMessageTriggers(npc)`
- Then `sendProactiveNPCMessage(npc, reason, context)`

**Result:**
- Message appears in chat history
- Unread badge increments
- If chat open: Shows immediately
- Stores in memory: "I messaged the boss: X"

---

## 🔴 Feature 5: Unread Message Notifications

### Visual Indicators

**People Tab - Chat Button:**
```html
Chat [Badge: 2]
```
- Red badge appears on top-right of Chat button
- Shows count of unread messages (max displays "9+")
- Badge has glow effect and pulse animation
- Color: `#ff3366` with shadow

### Badge System

**When Badge Appears:**
1. NPC sends proactive message (chat closed)
2. NPC replies to player message (chat closed)
3. Any async message completes after chat closes

**When Badge Clears:**
- Player opens that NPC's chat
- Count resets to 0 automatically

### Auto-Refresh
People tab auto-refreshes when:
- New message received (if tab is visible)
- Chat opened (clears badge)
- Any stat update occurs

---

## 🎯 Feature 6: Enhanced Social Interactions

### 6A: NPCs Mention @TheBoss

**When It Happens:**
- 5-20% chance per post (based on affection)
- Only on: text, work, food, life_update posts
- Higher affection = more likely to mention boss

**Tone Based on Relationship:**
- **Intimate (60+)**: "warmly and casually"
  - Example: "@TheBoss you're the best 💕"
- **High Affection (50+)**: "appreciatively"
  - Example: "Thanks @TheBoss for the feedback!"
- **Professional**: "professionally"
  - Example: "Meeting with @TheBoss went well"

**AI Prompt:**
```javascript
mentionInstruction = `
💡 Consider naturally mentioning your boss @TheBoss if relevant. 
Be ${tone}. 
Examples: "Meeting with @TheBoss went great!", 
"Thanks @TheBoss for the feedback"
Only mention if it feels natural!
`;
```

### 6B: Automatic NPC Reactions

**NPCs now auto-like player posts!**

**Reaction Logic:**

1. **Reactor Count Calculation:**
   - **Explicit posts** (level 3+): 1-2 reactors max (discreet)
   - **Meme posts**: Up to 4 reactors (40% of employees)
   - **Normal posts**: 1-3 reactors (25% of employees)

2. **Weighted Selection:**
   - **Base weight**: 1.0
   - **Affection bonus**: +1.0 (affection/100)
   - **Relationship bonus**: +1.0 (relationship/100)
   - **Total weight range**: 1.0 - 3.0

   Higher affection = more likely to react first

3. **Staggered Timing:**
   - First reactor: 3-8 seconds after post
   - Each additional: +2-5 seconds stagger
   - Feels natural and realistic

**Implementation:**
```javascript
triggerAutomaticNPCReactions(post)
  → Select reactors (weighted by affection)
  → Each adds like with delay
  → Stores in memory
  → Refreshes feed
```

**Memory:**
- Stored as: "I liked the boss's post: [content]"
- Importance: 0.5 (minor interaction)

---

## 🧠 Memory & Context Integration

### What Gets Remembered

**Player Actions:**
- Comments on posts → Stored in NPC memory
- Posts to feed → All employees remember
- Chats with NPCs → Full history saved

**NPC Actions:**
- Proactive messages → "I messaged the boss"
- Comment replies → "Boss commented X, I replied Y"
- Likes/Reactions → "I liked the boss's post"

### Context Flow

```
Player Posts
  ↓
All NPCs Remember
  ↓
Weighted Selection (affection-based)

Auto-reactions (likes)
  ↓
Stored in memory

Future conversations reference this
