# Tomorrow's Implementation Plan
*Created: October 10, 2025*

## 🎯 Goals Overview
1. **Expand Clicker Game** - Better balance + new content + boss fights
2. **Rework Conversation Context** - Social feed integration
3. **Improve AI Caption/Image Cohesion** - Better visual consistency

---

## 📊 1. CLICKER GAME EXPANSION

### A. Economy Rebalancing

**Current Issues to Address:**
- Game progression feels slow
- Long waits between meaningful upgrades
- Early game lacks engagement

**Proposed Changes:**

```javascript
// CURRENT VALUES TO ADJUST:
// Base product costs: Too high early game
// Income scaling: Too linear
// Upgrade multipliers: Not impactful enough

// SUGGESTED NEW FORMULA:
baseIncome = Math.pow(1.15, level) * baseCost * 0.1  // More exponential growth
upgradeCost = baseCost * Math.pow(1.5, level)        // Gentler cost scaling
clickValue = 1 + (playerLevel * 2)                    // More satisfying clicks
```

**Key Metrics to Target:**
- First product unlocked: ~10 seconds of clicking
- Second product unlocked: ~30 seconds of gameplay
- First employee hired: ~2 minutes
- First location upgrade: ~5 minutes
- Mid-game should feel like constant progress

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Add `gameBalance` object to store all economy constants
- [ ] Create function to calculate optimal product costs
- [ ] Adjust income multipliers per location
- [ ] Add "prestige" or "boost" system for late game scaling
- [ ] Implement temporary income boosts (2x for 30 seconds, etc.)

{
  id: 'product_marketing_01',
  name: 'Social Media Campaign',
  location: 'marketing',
  baseCost: 500,
  baseIncome: 5,
  description: 'Viral posts generate passive income',
  unlockRequirement: { cash: 400 },
  emoji: '📱'
}
```

---

### C. Boss Fight System

**Concept:**
- Boss "challenges" unlock new locations
- Click-based combat with RPG-lite mechanics
- Requires strategic upgrades to succeed

**Boss Fight Flow:**
```
1. Player clicks "Challenge" button on locked location
2. Modal opens with boss fight interface
3. Boss has health bar (e.g., 10,000 HP)
4. Each click deals damage based on player's click power
5. Timer counts down (e.g., 60 seconds)
6. NPCs provide passive DPS based on their levels
7. Win = unlock location + rewards
8. Lose = keep trying, maybe with small penalty
```

**Boss Fight Attributes:**
```javascript
{
  locationId: 'marketing',
  bossName: 'The Marketing Director',
  bossHealth: 10000,
  timeLimit: 60,
  rewardCash: 5000,
  rewardMultiplier: 1.5,
  requiredClickPower: 10, // Minimum to attempt
  difficulty: 'medium'
}
```

**Player Upgrade System:**
```javascript
playerUpgrades = {
  clickPower: {
    level: 0,
    cost: (level) => 1000 * Math.pow(2, level),
    effect: (level) => 10 + (level * 5) // +5 damage per level
  },
  autoClickSpeed: {
    level: 0,
    cost: (level) => 2000 * Math.pow(2, level),
    effect: (level) => level * 2 // +2 auto-clicks per second per level
  },
  npcBossBonus: {
    level: 0,
    cost: (level) => 3000 * Math.pow(2, level),
    effect: (level) => 1 + (level * 0.5) // NPCs deal 50% more per level
  }
}
```

**UI Elements Needed:**
- Boss challenge button on locked locations
- Boss fight modal with health bar, timer, damage numbers
- Player upgrade shop in new tab or HR section
- Victory/defeat animations

## 💬 2. CONVERSATION CONTEXT REWORK

### A. Social Feed Integration

**Goal:** NPCs should remember their posts and reference them in conversations

**Implementation Strategy:**

```javascript
// 1. Store post IDs in employee memory when they post
function createSocialPost(employee, content) {
  const post = {
    id: generateId(),
    authorId: employee.id,
    content: content,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
  
  // Add to global feed
  gameState.socialFeed.push(post);
  
  // Remember this in employee's memory
  remember(employee, `I posted: "${content}"`, 'event', 2.0);
  
  return post;
}

// 2. When building chat prompt, include recent posts
function buildChatPrompt(emp, conversationHistory, lastMessage) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Retrieve employee's recent posts
  const myRecentPosts = gameState.socialFeed
    .filter(p => p.authorId === emp.id)
    .slice(-5)
    .map(p => `I posted: "${p.content}"`);
  
  // Add to context
  const contextFacts = [
    `You are ${emp.name}, ${emp.position} at the company.`,
    `Current relationship stats: ${mood}`,
    ...myRecentPosts,
    ...relevant.slice(0, 20).map(i => `Remember: ${i.text}`)
  ].join('\n');
  
  // ... rest of function ...
}
```

**Conversation Hooks to Add:**
- "What did you mean by [post topic]?"
- "I saw your post about [topic]..."
- "That photo you posted was..."
- Player can reference specific posts and NPC understands

---

### B. NPC-to-NPC Relationship Tracking

**Goal:** NPCs know each other and can discuss coworkers

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Add to employee object
employee.relationships = {
  'employee_id_2': {
    knows: true,
    relationship: 'friend', // friend, rival, crush, neutral, dislikes
    sharedEvents: [
      'Worked on project together',
      'Had lunch together',
      'Dated briefly'
    ],
    relationshipLevel: 60 // 0-100
  }
}

// Track coworker interactions
function logCoworkerInteraction(emp1, emp2, event) {
  if (!emp1.relationships) emp1.relationships = {};
  if (!emp2.relationships) emp2.relationships = {};
  
  // Initialize relationship if doesn't exist
  if (!emp1.relationships[emp2.id]) {
    emp1.relationships[emp2.id] = {
      knows: true,
      relationship: 'neutral',
      sharedEvents: [],
      relationshipLevel: 30
    };
  }
  
  // Add event and update level
  emp1.relationships[emp2.id].sharedEvents.push(event);
  emp1.relationships[emp2.id].relationshipLevel += 5;
  
  // Mirror for emp2
  // ... same logic ...
}
```

**Integration into Chat:**
```javascript
// When player mentions another employee name
if (lastMessage.match(/Sarah|John|etc/)) {
  const mentionedEmp = findEmployeeByName(extractedName);
  
  if (mentionedEmp && emp.relationships[mentionedEmp.id]) {
    const rel = emp.relationships[mentionedEmp.id];
    
    // Add to context
    contextFacts.push(
      `About ${mentionedEmp.name}: We ${rel.relationship}, relationship at ${rel.relationshipLevel}%`,
      ...rel.sharedEvents.slice(-3)
    );
  }
}
```

**Automatic Relationship Building:**
- Same location = increases relationship
- Similar interests/hobbies = increases relationship
- Both mentioned in company events = shared memories
- Random "water cooler" events between NPCs

## 🎨 3. IMPROVE IMAGE-CAPTION COHESION

### Current Issues:
- AI captions don't always match generated images
- Image prompts are too generic
- Lack of visual consistency for same NPC

### Solutions:

**A. Better Image Prompt Construction**

```javascript
// BEFORE (simplified):
const imagePrompt = `${caption}`;

// AFTER (enhanced):
function buildImagePromptFromCaption(employee, caption, postType) {
  // Extract key elements from caption
  const captionAnalysis = await generateText(`
    Analyze this social media caption and extract:
    1. Main activity/scene
    2. Location/setting
    3. Mood/emotion
    4. Any specific details mentioned
    
    Caption: "${caption}"
    
    Return JSON format:
    {
      "activity": "...",
      "location": "...", 
      "mood": "...",
      "details": ["...", "..."]
    }
  `);
  
  const analysis = JSON.parse(captionAnalysis);
  
  // Build detailed prompt
  const imagePrompt = `
    Photo for social media post.
    
    Person: ${employee.appearance} // Store consistent appearance description
    Activity: ${analysis.activity}
    Location: ${analysis.location}
    Mood: ${analysis.mood}
    Details: ${analysis.details.join(', ')}
    Style: ${postType === 'selfie' ? 'selfie angle, casual' : 'photo'}
    
    Make sure the image clearly shows: ${analysis.activity}
  `.trim();
  
  return imagePrompt;
}
```

**B. Consistent Appearance Tracking**

```javascript
// Store appearance description for each employee
employee.appearance = {
  age: 28,
  gender: 'female',
  ethnicity: 'Asian',
  hair: 'long black hair',
  build: 'athletic',
  style: 'professional casual',
  distinctive: 'glasses, warm smile',
  
  // Generate consistent prompt string
  toString() {
    return `${this.age} year old ${this.ethnicity} ${this.gender}, ${this.hair}, ${this.build} build, wearing ${this.style}, ${this.distinctive}`;
  }
};

// Use in ALL image generations for this NPC
const imagePrompt = `${employee.appearance.toString()}, ${sceneDescription}`;
```

**C. Post-Generation Validation**

```javascript
// Optional: Validate that image matches caption
async function validateImageCaptionMatch(imagePrompt, caption) {
  const validation = await generateText(`
    Does this image description match the caption intent?
    
    Image: "${imagePrompt}"
    Caption: "${caption}"
    
    Respond with:
    - MATCH if they align well
    - MISMATCH if they don't
    - SUGGEST: [better prompt] if mismatch
  `);
  
  if (validation.includes('MISMATCH')) {
    // Regenerate with suggested prompt
    // Or show warning to player
  }
}
```
