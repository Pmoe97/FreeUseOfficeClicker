# Quick Summary - Social System Overhaul

## What Was Done

Transformed the social system from a static feed into a **living, reactive ecosystem**!

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Player @TheBoss Username ✅
- You're now **@TheBoss** on the social feed
- Special red/pink styling with glow effect
- Shows in all your posts and comments
- NPCs can mention you naturally

### 2. NPC Comment Replies ✅  
- NPCs automatically reply to your comments (70% chance)
- **Tone adapts** to your relationship:
  - High intimacy → Flirty: "Thanks babe 😏"
  - Close relationship → Warm: "Aww you're sweet! 💕"
  - Professional → Polite: "Thanks for the feedback"
- Replies appear 2-5 seconds after your comment

### 3. Closed Chat Fix ✅
- **Fixed bug**: Responses now complete even if you close chat
- Messages wait for you in history
- Unread badge appears automatically
- No more failed responses!

### 4. Proactive NPC Messaging ✅
- **NPCs message YOU first!**
- Based on relationship, time since last chat, events
- Message types:
  - Work questions: "Quick question about the project..."
  - Casual: "Hey! How's your day?"
  - Flirty: "Thinking about you 😏"
  - Booty calls: "Free tonight? 👀"
- Checks every 2 minutes, 5-50% chance per NPC

### 5. Unread Message Badges ✅
- Red badges on Chat buttons show unread count
- Appear when NPCs message you (chat closed)
- Clear automatically when you open chat
- Glow effect for visibility

### 6. Boss Mentions in Posts ✅
- NPCs mention @TheBoss in their posts (5-20% chance)
- Higher affection = more mentions
- Tone matches relationship level
- Natural integration, not forced

### 7. Auto-Reactions to Your Posts ✅
- NPCs automatically like your posts!
- 1-4 NPCs react based on post type
- Weighted by affection (close friends first)
- Staggered timing (2-5 seconds between reactions)
- Fewer reactions on explicit posts (discreet)
